## Introduction
The Dog Breed Prediction project aims to develop a powerful deep learning neural network capable of accurately classifying dog breeds. By leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow and employing transfer learning with the Xception model, this project pushes the boundaries of canine breed classification.

## Dataset and Model
The dataset used in this project consists of training and test sets containing images of dogs. Each image is uniquely identified by its filename, and the dataset comprises 120 different breeds of dogs. For this project, the focus is on the top 10 most populated dog breeds in the dataset: Scottish Deerhound, Maltese Dog, Afghan Hound, Entlebucher, Bernese Mountain Dog, Shih-Tzu, Great Pyrenees, Pomeranian, Basenji, and Samoyed.

The data source for this project is available on Kaggle, providing a rich collection of images for training and evaluation purposes.

The model employed in this project is the Xception model, a highly accurate and efficient pre-trained deep learning model. By utilizing transfer learning, the model is able to leverage the knowledge learned from a large dataset to accurately classify the dog breeds in the test set.

## Results
Through extensive training and fine-tuning, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 95.65% on the test set. This exceptional performance showcases the model's ability to discern intricate patterns and features that differentiate one dog breed from another.

## Deployment
To make the project more accessible and interactive, a deployment site has been created. The Dog Breed Classifier application allows users to upload their own dog images and witness the model's real-time predictions of the respective breed.
