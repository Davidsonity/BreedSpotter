### INTRODUCTION
#### Objectives
The objective of this project is to build powerful Deep Learning Neural network that can classify dog breeds with high accuracy.

In this project we made use of TensorFlow [![forthebadge made-with-python](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/tensorflow.png)](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

We would also be using transfer learning. The model used is the Xception model.

#### About Dataset
The data is provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. For this project, the top 10 most populated dog breed in the datset are used to train the model. 

The list of breeds is as follows:

- scottish deerhound
- maltese dog
- afghan hound 
- entlebucher 
- bernese mountain dog 
- shih-tzu
- great pyrenees
- pomeranian
- basenji
- samoyed
