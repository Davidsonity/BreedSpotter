### INTRODUCTION
#### Objectives
The objective of this project is to build powerful Deep Learning Neural network that can classify these images with more accuracy.
In this project we made use of transfer learning. The model used in the Xception

#### About Dataset
The data is provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. For this project, the top 10 most populated dog breed in the datset are used to train the model. 

The list of breeds is as follows:

- scottish deerhound
- maltese dog
- afghan hound 
- entlebucher 
- bernese mountain dog 
- shih-tzu
- great pyrenees
- pomeranian
- basenji
