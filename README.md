This repository contains the code and resources for the Dog Breed Prediction project, which aims to accurately classify dog breeds using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction
The Dog Breed Prediction project utilizes TensorFlow and transfer learning with the Xception model to develop a powerful neural network capable of identifying dog breeds with high accuracy. The project focuses on the top 10 most populated dog breeds from a dataset comprising 120 different breeds.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of training and test sets containing images of dogs. Each image is uniquely identified by its filename, and the dataset provides a comprehensive collection of dog breed images for training and evaluation purposes. The data source for this project is available on Kaggle.

## Model
The model employed in this project is the Xception model, a pre-trained deep learning model known for its accuracy and efficiency. By leveraging transfer learning, the model can utilize the knowledge learned from a large dataset to accurately classify the dog breeds in the test set.

## Results
After extensive training and fine-tuning, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 95.65% on the test set. This performance demonstrates the model's ability to identify intricate patterns and features that differentiate one dog breed from another.

## Deployment
To make the project more accessible and interactive, a deployment site has been created. The Dog Breed Classifier application allows users to upload their own dog images and witness the model's real-time predictions of the respective breed.

## Conclusion
The Dog Breed Prediction project demonstrates the power of deep learning and transfer learning in accurately classifying dog breeds. By harnessing the capabilities of TensorFlow and the Xception model, this project achieves remarkable accuracy and showcases the potential of artificial intelligence in image classification tasks.

Stay tuned for more advancements in machine learning and computer vision, as the Dog Breed Prediction project continues to unlock new possibilities in the field of canine breed identification.
